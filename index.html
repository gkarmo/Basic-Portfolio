                    Gayah Karmo, born 1996 and still doing my thing. Born in Monrovia, Liberia and migrated here with my family December of 1999, and even though I did not have much say in that decision (I was only three), it has definately the most impactful one in my life. Throughout my life I have been blessed enough to have the best supporting cast around me that anyone growing up in a foriegn land could dream of having, my parents. With the help of my parents I have been through many types of schooling programs, which molded me to who I am today. This started with public schools during my elementry years, boarding school for junior high, catholic school for high school, college, and now my first ever live online course.

                    I like to believe I am a pretty laid back guy, like the ones you see at the party with the shades on indoors. When it comes to sports my field of expertise would be football and basketball, which I had the pleasure of playing both in high school. My favorite teams would be any team located in the city of Philadelphia with an exception to where ever LeBron James takes his talents. I initially went to college for nursing mostly because I think that's the only thing African parents believe is taught there, but after giving it a try for a year I finally was explain that I would like to take my struggles to computer science. Since making the switch I've had a lot of ups and downs, but with the help of Penn LPS I can finally see a pot of gold at the end of this beautiful rainbow of education I began since pre-school.
